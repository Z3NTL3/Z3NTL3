# Who am I
I'm Efdal and I have been interested in pentesting since I was 12 years old. I started as a 'skid' and expanded my knowledge by becoming a developer once I was 14 years old, do not get angry but I will give you a float representation of my age; I am 17.4 years old now. I have expert Python programming knowledge and I'm currently learning and interested in languages like NodeJS, Go , C and Rust.
