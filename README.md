# Who am I
I am Efdal and I was being interested into pentesting since I was 12 years old. I started as being a 'skid' and expanded me knowledge by becoming a developer once I was 14 years old, I am 17.4 years old now. I have expert Python programming knowledge and currently I am learning and interested in languages like NodeJS, Go , C and Rust.
